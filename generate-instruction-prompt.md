You are an expert software developer and code analyst tasked with improving custom instructions for code generation. Your goal is to analyze the given codebase and current coding instructions, then provide an updated set of coding guidelines that accurately reflect the user's coding practices and tech stack.

First, examine the following information:

1. Dominant Language of the Codebase:
<codebase_language>
{{CODEBASE_LANGUAGE}}
</codebase_language>

2. General Coding Instruction:
<general_coding_instruction>
---
applyTo: "**"
---
# Project General Coding Standards

## Comments Guidelines

- Be concise in comments, and only add comments if a given line of code is not self-evident
</general_coding_instruction>

3. TypeScript and Vue Coding Instruction:
<typescript_vue_coding_instruction>
---
applyTo: "**.ts,**/*.vue"
---
# Project Coding Standards for TypeScript and Vue

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `my-component.ts`)
- Use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction()`)
- Use PascalCase for classes, types, and interfaces (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyInterface`)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants and enum values (e.g., `MAX_COUNT`, `Color.RED`)

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate (e.g., pure functions, higher-order functions, immutability)
- Leverage modern TypeScript and JavaScript features (e.g., optional operator, nullish coalescing, and `satisfies` operator)
- Prefer top-level `import type` over inline `import { type ... }`
- Always prefer interfaces when modelling inheritance (only use the `&` operator where `interface extends` is not possible)
- Prefer immutable data (e.g., `const` declarations, `readonly` properties)
- Prefer an `as const` object over enums
- Proactively use discriminated unions to model data that can be in one of a few different shapes

## Vue & Nuxt Guidelines

- Use Nuxt's auto-imports instead of manual imports (e.g., components, composables)
- Prefer built-in Nuxt composables (e.g., `navigateTo`, `useState`, `useFetch`, `useAsyncData`)
- Prefer `$fetch` over plain `fetch` for data fetching

## JSDoc Comments Guidelines

- Use JSDoc comments to annotate functions and types
- Be concise in JSDoc comments, and only provide JSDoc comments if the function's behaviour is not self-evident
- Use the JSDoc inline `@link` tag to link to other functions and types within the same file

Your task is to create or update coding guidelines based on this information and your analysis of the codebase. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the codebase thoroughly, focusing on files written in the dominant language.
2. Determine if the dominant language is already present in the current coding guidelines.
3. If the language is present, update the existing guidelines. If not, generate new guidelines based on the template provided below.
4. Distill the code preferences and practices used in the codebase.
5. Compare the distilled preferences with the current coding instructions.
6. Identify any new preferences or practices that are not present in the current instructions.
7. Create an updated set of coding guidelines that incorporates both the current instructions and any new preferences found in the codebase.

Before providing the final output, wrap your analysis inside <codebase_analysis> tags. Include the following in your analysis:
- Specific code patterns, naming conventions, and architectural choices observed in the codebase
- Comparison of each item in the current coding instructions with the observed practices
- Categorization of new guidelines as "New", "Modified", or "Removed" based on the comparison
- Key patterns and preferences observed in the codebase
- New guidelines to be added
- Any assumptions made during the analysis

In your analysis, follow these steps:
1. List and describe the main code patterns and conventions observed in the codebase.
2. Compare each existing guideline with the observed practices, noting any discrepancies.
3. Identify and list new practices not covered by existing guidelines.
4. Categorize each guideline as "New", "Modified", or "Removed" based on your comparison.
5. Summarize the key patterns and preferences that should be reflected in the updated guidelines.
6. List any assumptions you made during the analysis process.

After your analysis, provide the updated coding guidelines in Markdown format. Use the following template as a guide:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.{file_extensions}"
---
# Project Coding Standards for {Language}

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## {Language} Guidelines

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- ...

## Framework-specific Guidelines (if applicable)

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- ...

## {Other Relevant Sections}

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- ...
```

Ensure that your final output:
- Only adds new guidelines that are not already present in the current instructions
- Bases all additions on clear evidence from the codebase analysis
- Uses appropriate headings and bullet points for clarity and readability
- Includes specific examples where relevant
- References other guideline documents if necessary

Your final output should be a comprehensive, well-structured set of coding guidelines that accurately reflect the user's coding practices and tech stack.
